# vue-js-crd-test
This is a purely frontend Vue JS application that allows the user to add items, remove items and contains some frontend validation. I built this following a documentation tutorial in order to get a better sense of best practices for Vue JS folder structures, and various fundamental features of the framework.

It is not an exhaustive project by any means, but I am adding it here for reference as I continue to build more web apps utilizing VueJS.
